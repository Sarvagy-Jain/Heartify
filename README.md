# Heartify

The prediction of in-hospital mortality for intensive care units (ICU)-admitted HF patients remain poorly characterized. We aimed to develop and validate a prediction model for all-cause in-hospital mortality among ICU-admitted HF patients.Various ML algorithms implemented on a data set of heart attacks from kaggle in jupyter notebook using python, results are analysed and compared of various models.
